       14) Square - Calculating the side of square from it's perimeter
       15) TAC - Area of Triangle, also in Square centimetres and square inches.
       16) UniversityDis - This Java program calculates the discounted fee for a university student by taking the original fee and discount                   percentage as input, computing the discount amount, and displaying both the discount and final payable fee.
       17) ChocolateDistribution - This Java program distributes chocolates among children by taking the total number of chocolates and children              as input, ensuring the number of children is not zero to avoid division errors. It then calculates and displays how many chocolates                each child receives and how many are left undistributed.
       18) City - It takes three integer inputs and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, division, and modulus) to                 display results. It collects user input for a trip, including city names, distances, and travel time, then calculates and displays the             total distance and average speed of the journey.
       19) DOperation - This Java program takes three double values as input and performs four arithmetic operations: addition with                           multiplication, multiplication with addition, division with addition, and modulus with addition. It then displays the results of these             operations with double precision.
       20) Operation - This Java program takes three integer inputs and performs four arithmetic operations: addition with multiplication,                    multiplication with addition, division with addition, and modulus with addition. It then displays the results of these operations.
       21) Park  - This Java program calculates how many rounds an athlete can run around a triangular park. It takes the three sides of the                  triangle as input, computes the perimeter, and then determines the number of rounds needed to complete a total distance of 5000 meters.
       22) PoundsToKilograms - Converting Pounds to Kilograms
       23) Quotient - This Java program takes two integer inputs and calculates their quotient and remainder using division and modulus                       operations. It then displays the results along with the original numbers.
       24) Simple - This Java program calculates simple interest based on user input for principal amount, rate of interest, and time period. It              applies the formula SI = (P × R × T) / 100 and displays the computed simple interest.
       25) Swap - This Java program swaps two integer values entered by the user using a temporary variable and then displays the swapped values.
       26) Temp -
